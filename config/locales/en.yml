        text_html:
          There is no other tool that can "search followers" like %{app}.
          The reason is that searching thousands to millions of followers in real time requires a high skill level and huge computing resources. <br>
          <br>
          %{app} was created by the same development team that created egotter &copy; the world's most advanced Twitter analysis tool for over a decade,
          so %{app} provides world-class search speed and safety.
